Custom types
============

Across many of the atmospheric parameters/sections you'll
come across the ``custom`` type. These allow you to inject your
own code to be used in the forward model and retrieval scheme.

Developing or wrapping your own parameters is discussed in the
:ref:`Developers` guide.
